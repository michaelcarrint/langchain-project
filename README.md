# 🌱 My LangChain Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋

This repo is where I'm documenting my journey as I learn 
[LangChain](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/langchain/lesson/xf7wh/models,-prompts-and-parsers). 
I'm diving into building with large language models, 
and LangChain seems like the perfect framework to explore that.

## 💬 Why I'm Doing This

I'm a big believer in learning in public — it keeps me accountable and turns solo learning 
into something a little more social. This repo is my space to reflect, break things, fix 
them, and hopefully make something cool in the process.

If you're on a similar path, feel free to connect or open a PR. Would love to see what you're 
building too!
